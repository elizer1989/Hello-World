# Hello-World
Hello Friends, 
My name is Elizer Barbosa. I recently got into coding and love everything about it with a passion! 
I look forward to learning more about programming and coding in the coming months! 
I am currently familiar with HTML5 CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap => some PHP, MySQL. My goal is to learn The MEAN stack this year.
